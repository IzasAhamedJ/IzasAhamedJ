💫 About Me

Hi there! 👋 I'm Izas Ahamed, a passionate Front-End Developer with a growing love for full-stack development.

🔭 Currently working at Tarkiz.info Tech

💻 I work mainly with Angular, but I also enjoy building with React.js, Node.js, and Express.js

🌱 Currently learning: Full-stack best practices, REST APIs, and improving my backend with Node & Express

🤝 Open to collaborating on exciting web projects and learning from other developers

💬 Ask me about anything in Angular, React, or modern JavaScript

⚡ Fun fact: I once fixed a UI bug by accident and learned more from that than from an entire tutorial 😄
